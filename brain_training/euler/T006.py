# The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is, 12 + 22 + ... + 102 = 385 The square of the sum of the
# first ten natural numbers is, (1 + 2 + ... + 10)2 = 552 = 3025 Hence the difference between the sum of the squares
# of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640. Find the difference between the
# sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
